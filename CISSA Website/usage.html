			<h3>Getting started</h3>
	
			<section id="systemrequirements" align="left">
				<p>CyberSAGE does not need any installation on the users system.
					It does not make any changes to the systems registry,services,etc.
					CyberSAGE however does create some folders on the users system for
					the purpose of storing the models.The user may double click the
					executable to begin using the tool. A one time welcome screen is
					seen when CyberSAGE is started for the first time.

				</p>
				<p>
					First time users of CyberSAGE may download our <a
						href="https://www.illinois.adsc.com.sg/cybersage/Smart Grid Project.zip">sample
						project</a> which contains all the input models in a zipped format.
					Upon download these may be directly imported into CyberSAGE tool via
					the <b>Menu -> Import Project</b> option of the menu bar. The models
					will be automatically unzipped** and loaded into the project
					workspace.

				<h3>Input Models</h3>
				<p>The various pieces of diverse information such as business
					processes, network topology and adversary information will be
					represented by CyberSAGE as input models. These will be used to
					initialize the graph generation engine. Let us discuss each of these
					models in the following sections.</p>
				<h4>
					<b><i>Workflow modelling</i></b>
				</h4>
				<p>Workflows describe the business processes of a system. They
					represent a series of activity that need to be performed for the
					accomplishment of a given task. The default workflow model included
					in the sample project is a simple workflow detailing the
					interactions that take place a DMS and RTU in a smart grid
					environment. More complicated workflows with non sequential
					execution interactions are also supported by CyberSAGE and details
					for the same are available in the ``User Manual``.</p>
	
				<figure align="center">
					<a href="img/image04.png"><img src="img/image04.png"
						title="Sample workflow model" /> </a>
					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 4 : Sample workflow model</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
	
				<h4>
					<b><i>System modelling</i></b>
				</h4>
				<p>A system model describes all the components of the proposed
					system under study. It is similar in concept to the network diagram
					of the system. CyberSAGE allows such models to be created within the
					application itself using specialized editors. Please refer to our
					``User Manual`` on how to create such system models. The model
					included in the default project shows interactions between an
					abstracted set of components typically found in a smart grid
					environment.</p>

						title="Sample workflow model" width="50%" /> </a>
					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 5 : Sample system model</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Single clicking on any of the components of the system model
					on the graphical canvas will trigger the property sheet editor which
					allows user to change any of the default specified values.</p>

					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 6 : Property sheet editor to update properties for
							the HMI component</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
	
	
				<h4>
					<b><i>Attacker modelling</i></b>
				</h4>
				<p>Compared to the well-defined workflow and system models,
					CyberSAGE adversary models are less complex. In CyberSAGE we define
					an attacker from the perspective of the amount of resources
					(manpower, money) , level of access ( physical access or network
					access to systems) and the skillset (hacking capabilities) possessed
					by the attacker. We use this information to argue whether the
					devices in the system under study can be compromised by this
					particular attacker or not. We include two sample models in our
					default project, one of a fairly powerful attacker and the other of
					a fairly weak attacker.</p>

						<b>Figure 7 : Sample attacker model</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Single clicking on any of the axis of the attacker model will
					trigger the property sheet editor which allows user to change any of
					the default specified values.</p>

			<section id="drools">
				<h3>Drools Rule Engine</h3>
	
				<p>The rules files cannot be loaded into the canvas drawing
					space. Instead double click on the rules file to open it into the
					default text editor of your system ***. You may edit the rules file
					or for the sake of simplicity keep using the sample ones that have
					been provided as is. Drools rule updation is a complicated procedure
					and is dealt with in the user manual.</p>

						<b>Figure 9 : Drools rule files open in Notepad ++</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

			<section id="argraph">
				<h3>Argument Graph Generation & Evaluation</h3>
	
				<p>In order to run an evaluation for the specified input models
					you may select “Run Assessment” from menu bar and click ``Generate
					Argument Graph``.</p>
	
				<figure align="center">
					<a href="img/image12.png"><img src="img/image12.png"
						title="Initiate an assessment" /> </a>
					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 10 : Initiate an assessment</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
	
				<p>Select the input models and the rule file against which the
					evaluation needs to run. The simplest rule file is the GGraphRule
					file which associates a goal to the workflow node, the GSGraphRule
					file associates the devices of the system model to the workflow
					nodes plus the capabilities of the GGraphRule file while finally,
					the GSAGraphRule file associates the attacker to the device plus the
					capabilities of the GGraphRule and GSGraphRule files.Lets select the
					GSAGraphRule file. Click on the ``Generate`` button to being the
					assessment process.</p>
	
				<figure align="center">
					<a href="img/image00.png"><img src="img/image00.png"
						title="Select the models and rule files to initiate an assessment"

					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 11 : Select the models and rule files to initiate an
							assessment</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>CyberSAGE is able to relate the workflow and system models via
					the mapping of the actors that operate on specific workflow steps to
					the corresponding devices in the system model. An incorrect mapping
					will result in inaccurate results being generated. The workflow
					actors are specified via names on the top of rectangular swim lines
					within which the workflow step is contained. For example in our
					sample project we have three actors namely DMS-A , RTU-1 & RTU-2.
					Select the correct mapping between the workflow steps and the device
					actors in the pop up dialog.</p>

						title="Workflow Actor - Device Mapping default initialization" />
					</a>
					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 12 : Workflow Actor - Device Mapping default
							initialization</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>If you are running CyberSAGE for the first time the mappings
					will be initialized to “Unspecified” and you will be expected to
					select the correct mapping via the dropdown combobox.</p>
	
				<figure align="center">
					<a href="img/image11.png"><img src="img/image11.png"
						title="Workflow Actor - Device Mapping" /> </a>
					<figcaption class="center-block">
						<b>Figure 13 : Workflow Actor - Device Mapping</b>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>CyberSAGE is able to remember the mappings for the specified
					workflow - system model and hence subsequently the next time an
					evaluation is attempted the mappings will be reloaded. Click on
					``Generate`` button to initiate the evaluation process.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="outmodel">
				<h3>Output Models</h3>
	
				<p>The evaluation process may take a few seconds (a rough
					estimate would be 10-15 seconds but this largely depends on the
					network connection bandwidth to the CyberSAGE server). If the
					evaluation is successful you will be prompted to provide a name for
					the output model. The resultant argument graph will also be loaded
					into the canvas area of CyberSAGE. If no graph is seen then you may
					need to see the log files for any diagnostic messages at
					$USER_HOME/cybersage/log.</p>
	
				<figure align="center">
					<a href="img/image15.png"><img src="img/image15.png" width="50%"

						<b>Figure 14 : Assessment result showing the argument graph on

				</figure>
	
				<p>
					CyberSAGE shows useful statistical information about every workflow,
					system and adversary node in the generated argument graph. Clicking
					on any of the node of the graph will update the property sheet with
					these per node statistics. </br>
					</br> <b>**</b> In order for the sample projects to be successfully
					loaded into the project workspace CyberSAGE expects an unzipping
					software such as WinZIP to be installed on the users system the
					absence of which will cause the importing of the sample project to
					fail. The alternative to this would be to download some unzipping
					utility and manually unzip and place the model files in their
					correct folders at $USER_HOME/CSProject.</br>
					</br> <b>***</b> If upon double clicking the drools rule file, it does
					not open in any editor then it means that default editor of the
					system does not recognize a drool file extension (.drl is the
					extension for a drools rule file). In such case you may need to edit
					the preference settings of the default editor or alternatively go to
					the workspace location of the drools file i.e $USER_HOME/CSProject/
					<Project_Name>/4. Rules Engine and open the file in
					the default editor and permanently store the extension association.
					Another approach would be to update the registry.
